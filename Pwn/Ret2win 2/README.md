We are given a zipfile which when extracted gives a binary

Checking the file type and protections enabled on it shows this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2db95a41-2813-479c-b7d2-43d72b4e6996)

So we are working with a 64 bits executable which is dynamically linked and not stripped, from the protections enabled we see that there's Stack Canary present and NX is enabled

Let us run it to get an overview of what it does
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779cadb5-7269-4277-b93b-9e4adf1c3650)

So the program asks if we have any feedback, if we do not it exits else it receives 3 feedbacks from us

Interesting! in order to find the vulnerabiltiy we need to decompile the binary and my choice here is IDA

Here's the main function
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82d757f3-4df4-4069-ae0d-b29e47263bfe)

It just calls `init()` and the `challenge()` function

The first function just disables buffering on stdin, stdout & stderr

That's just standard pwn stuff

The next function does this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c15803f-2369-4703-97c3-a5c8858e47c3)

```c
__int64 challenge()
{
  char s1[5]; // [rsp+3h] [rbp-Dh] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v2; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-8h]

  v2 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  puts("Welcome to part two of the first pwn challenge");
  puts("What's a CTF without a beginners's pwn :)");
  puts("Would you like to give any feedback?");
  __isoc99_scanf("%4s", s1);
  getchar();
  if ( !strncmp(s1, "yes", 3uLL) )
  {
    feedback();
    return 0LL;
  }
  else
  {
    puts("Goodbye");
    return 1LL;
  }
}
```

So we can see that if our input is `yes` it would call the `feeback()` function so that means our bug is going to be there

Here's the decompilation of the function:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7a66526-44bf-472a-82bc-3e3eef36e544)

```c
__int64 feedback()
{
  void *buf; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-38h] BYREF
  char v2[40]; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-30h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v3; // [rsp+38h] [rbp-8h]

  v3 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  memset(v2, 0, sizeof(v2));
  buf = 0LL;
  puts("What's your first complaint.");
  read(0, &buf, 8uLL);
  puts("What's your second complaint..");
  read(0, buf, 8uLL);
  puts("What's your final complaint...");
  read(0, v2, 0x60uLL);
  puts("Ok thanks for your opinion");
  return 0LL;
}
```

Ok looking through that we see that it receives our input and stores it in `buf` then it yet again receives our input and stores it in `buf` and finally it receives our input and stores it in `v2`

There are two vulnerabilities there:
- Arbitrary Write to Memory (Write What Where)
- Buffer Overflow

The first bug comes from the fact that `&buf` is used, which gives the address of the buffer itself and we are reading into it, this means we are reading into the address pointed by buf which therefore gives us the ability to overwrite the address of `buf` and then we can reading into `buf` meaning we are reading into the address of buf

The second bug is an obvious overflow, since we are reading at most `0x60` bytes into a buffer that can only hold up `0x28` bytes

Now how do we exploit this?

Looking through the available functions we see this

Hmm, a backdoor function

Checking it shows this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2487856b-1cf2-483a-9e95-09ed44012b21)

```c
__int64 __fastcall backdoor(__int16 a1, __int16 a2)
{
  FILE *stream; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-40h]
  char ptr[40]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-30h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v5; // [rsp+48h] [rbp-8h]

  v5 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  stream = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  if ( stream )
  {
    if ( a1 == (__int16)0xDEAD && a2 == (__int16)0xBEEF )
    {
      ptr[fread(ptr, 1uLL, 0x27uLL, stream)] = 0;
      puts(ptr);
    }
    else
    {
      puts("Invalid keys");
    }
    fclose(stream);
    return 0LL;
  }
  else
  {
    puts("Error opening flag.txt, contact admin!");
    return 1LL;
  }
}
```

Basically this function requires two parameter and expects them to match `0xdead` & `0xbeef` respectively, if it does match then it prints the flag

Our goal is to call this function, but how do we exactly exploit the buffer overflow?

When we try to smash the stack we would overwrite the stack canary thereby failing the stack canary check and calling the `__stack_chk_fail` function
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ae42c7-6444-4c36-906f-7887025210b4)

We need to bypass this!

To do that we would leverage the Write-What-Where primitive to overwrite the GOT of the `__stack_chk_fail` function so that when it's called it justs `ret`

The idea is that when we overwrite the global offset table of the `__stack_chk_fail` function to a `ret` instruction, when we perform the buffer overflow the function is going to be called, but since it points to an instruction `ret` it would just return and continue execution like nothing happened which then allows us to overwrite the saved rbp and the return address because this is how the stack layout is:

```
buffer -> stack canary -> saved rbp -> return address
```
