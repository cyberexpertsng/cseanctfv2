I downloaded the file to my kali linux then I opened it

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/csean_ctf/steg/flakes]
└─# ls    
super.txt
                                                                                
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/csean_ctf/steg/flakes]
└─# cat super.txt                                         
Something isn't just right	     	 		       	     	   
	 	   	       	       	 	     	    		    
Something isn't just right
